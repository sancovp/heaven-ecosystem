## About HEAVEN
HEAVEN is a metaprogramming environment for AI agents. It can be configured to run on [HEAVEN FRAMEWORK](https://github.com/sancovp/heaven-framework/tree/main) or your favorite agent framework (if you make adaptors). HEAVEN can call down into either ADK, LangChain, or uni-api by default. 

#### Programming Paradigms You Know VS HEAVEN
- In Traditional Programming, a Human fills in the templates called programming syntax in order to speak a programming language. The acceptable symbols and way they work in the syntax is called a grammar.

- In LLM Programming (Vibe Coding, most agents, most workflows), AI fills in the templates and speaks the programming language for you (hopefully)
- But in the HEAVENly Approach, AI creates templates that create templates that create code that can evolve itself!

  The progression:
  1. Madlibs → "The {{NOUN}} {{VERB}} over the {{ADJECTIVE}} {{NOUN}}"
  2. Code Templates → class {{CLASS_NAME}}({{BASE_CLASS}})
  3. Meta-Templates → Templates that generate templates
  4. Makers → Code that writes code from templates
  5. Self-Modifying Systems → Templates evolving their own patterns that modify types of each other

#### How Does It Work?
Programming is pattern instantiation and LLMs are pattern instantiation machines. Everything else is higher levels of complexity derived from combinations of pattern instantiations. In principle, meta-templated examples enable LLMs to pattern match and madlib their way to working code.
